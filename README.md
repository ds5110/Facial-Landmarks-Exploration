# Introduction
The project focused on the computer vision project in DS5110.

### Feasibility

- Story: Distinguish whether an image is an adult or an infant.
- Data: [InfAnFace dataset](https://coe.northeastern.edu/Research/AClab/InfAnFace/), [300-W](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/300-W/)
- EDA: For a given test data set, we could get a classification scatter to show the accuracy of the model we choose.

### Information from Professor
Stakeholder: Michael Wan, PhD, Senior Computational Scientist in Northeastern’s Augmented Cognition Lab

Story/Goal: This computer-vision project will build on and complement a DS 5110 project from fall 2022 that used simple ML models to distinguish adult & infant faces in images. The project will involve traditional machine learning teachniques (i.e., no deep learning).

Data: Dr. Wan has been working with facial landmark coordinates from 300-W (adults) and InfAnFace (infants) datasets as described in InfAnFace paper, Wan et al, (2022) (2022) – arxiv.org

DS 5110 project ideas for spring 2023

## 1 -- Equitable health care

* Stakeholder -- Prof. Brianne Olivieri-Mui, Dept of Health Sciences
* Story: Hundreds of millions of federal dollars have been allocated for treatment and eradication HIV. The goal of this study is to look for socioeconomic factors that could give rise to more equitable allocation of funds. The results could have implications for policy makers and government agencies administering those funds.
* Data: Socieeconomic data at Census.gov added as a new data source to build on work done by DS 5110 students last fall.

## 2 -- Education in Maine

* Stakeholder: Jennifer Chace, now at Univ of Southern Maine, jennifer.chace@maine.edu
* Story: Explore conversations about education throughout the state of Maine showing how
the thoughts of concerns vary among citizens of the state, and relate these issues
to socioeconomic factors in each region.
This study will build on an project from Summer 2022 that focussed on text analysis of
a relatively small dataset (https://github.com/ds5110/project-darylel).
* Data: Socioeconomic data from Census.gov will be combined with transcriptions of conversations 
around Maine collected over the last year.
This project will build on an earlier project in the summer of 2022 that used a relatively small dataset
described [here](https://github.com/ds5110/project-darylel/blob/main/Manual.md).

## 3 -- Groups Recover Together

* Stakeholder: Chief Outcomes and Medical Officer, Groups Recover Together (joingroups.com), Portland, Maine
* Story: Groups Recover Together (GRT) is the nation's leading provider of outpatient addiction medicine services
and support to individuals struggling with all substance use disorders.
GRT is interested in identifying members at intake who are likely to discontinue treatment prematurely 
so that these members can be targeted with specific clinical interventions and resources to improve 
their outcomes and increase the likelihood of staying in treatment and receiving an adequate “dose” of treatment.
* Data: GRT has collected and anonymized data from new members who undergo an extensive evaluation 
process that involves the collection of lots of data, some structured and some not. 
This data source will be made available for the project and could lead to publication, 
but may require a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) at the beginning of the project.

## 4 -- Institute for Experiential AI

* Stakeholder -- Mark Wagy, PhD, Senior Data Scientist at The Roux Instute
* Story/Goal: We build machine learning models on a lot of datasets for various partners and industries. We would like t
o be able to have an automated process that we can run our algorithms against ground truth datasets to check whether the
y are biased or not. In this project we propose building such a tool.
* Data: [Law School Admission Dataset](http://www.seaphe.org/databases.php)
* **Other EIA project ideas that need to be fleshed out...**
  * Notebook to report workflow: Build a Github Action workflow that generates a report from a series of Jupyter noteboo
ks when annotated properly. Likely will make use of Scrapbook and Papermill; but open to other tooling.
  * EAI Data Lake. Set up a Data Lake that is searchable and self-documenting. It must allow for unstructured, semistruc
tured and structured data and be minimal cost that we can use to track public (and internal) data for use with projects.
  * ML Deployment Pipeline. A pipeline for monitoring and deployment of machine learning models.
  * Knowledge Graph for AI Solutions. Build a knowledge graph that can track, visualize and export entities and their re
lationships with expandable features. This one probably needs a lot more explanation but it is a cool project.
  * ML Bias Reference. Build a tool that generates synthetic dataset that we can use as an "ML Bias" point of reference. Operationally it would take in an ML algorithm and provides an indication of the level of bias in an ML algorithm with respect to a synthetic a reference dataset.

## 5 -- Non-profit health care

* Stakeholder: This project is for a local non-profit that wishes to remain anonymous for the moment, 
as the results of this project will impact future strategic decisions. 
Until public announcements are made, the partner wishes to control all communications about results 
to ensure consistent messaging and public communications. The lead from organization will work directly with students.
* The Story: Medically Underserved Populations (MUPs) have a shortage of primary care health services 
for a specific population subset within a geographic area. 
These groups may face economic, cultural, or language barriers to health care. Some examples include:
  * People experiencing homelessness
  * People who are low-income
  * People who are eligible for Medicaid
  * Native Americans
  * Migrant farm workers

## 6 -- Digital Equity

* Stakeholder: Maine Connectivity Authority (MCA)
* Story: MCA is is a quasi-governmental agency charged with achieving the universal access of affordable 
high-speed broadband in Maine. 
Allocation of funds need to be distributed in an equitable fashion, and the concept of "digital equity"
has emerged as an important metric for allocating those funds. The goal of this project is to build on
ongoing work to define digital equity around the nation and refine it for the state of Maine.
This project builds on previous work by DS 5010 students: https://ds5010.github.io/broadband/.
* Data: Socieconomic data from the American Community Survey (census.gov) and broadband data from the FCC (fcc.gov)
These datasets are entirely new, and were not used in previous work by DS 5010 students.
The goal of this project is to use publicly available data to investigate possible causal relationships in Maine.

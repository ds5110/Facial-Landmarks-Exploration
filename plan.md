# Goals

The goal of this project is to preprocess image landmark data, analyze the relationship between the landmark data and
face attributes, and improve accuracy and efficiency in potential applications of face recognition and expression
recognition. The program aims to identify a recommended scaling method, remove outliers from the data, and investigate
geometric relationships between landmark coordinates. The project will also analyze the selection of the center point
and rotation axis during the normalization process of landmark data and compare methods used by previous project teams
for facial expression recognition. The final outcome is expected to be an identified set of landmark differences between
different types of faces that could aid in developing a computer algorithm for identifying these types of faces.

# Data

The dataset for this project is the image landmark data from the "InfAnFace: Bridging the Infantâ€“Adult Domain Gap" paper
by Yang et al. (2021) and a private program "DS5110/faces" from DS5110 on the 2022 Fall semester. The dataset includes
image landmark data for infants and adults and face attributes including turned, tilted, occluded, and expressive. There
are no data-accessibility issues.

# Stakeholder feedback

There has been no stakeholder feedback at this time. The team plans to meet with the stakeholder on April 1st to review
progress and get feedback.

# EDA

Exploratory data analysis can be found in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/example/landmark-investigation

  stakeholder.

# Issues

One potential issue is the size of the dataset and the computational resources required to analyze it. Another potential
issue is the accuracy of the initial landmark data and how that could affect the final results.
